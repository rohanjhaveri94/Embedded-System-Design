*******************************************************************************************************************************************

This course is taken by Dr. Sudeep Pasricha at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. 
This course teaches us various techniques to emdedded system design concepts such as BIOS, hardware/software codesign, RTOS, SoC, NoC etc.
In this course, the professor also discussed about scheduling techniques used in RTOS, the importance of memory and power management in embedded systems. 
Also, he dicussed briefly about SystemC and it importance and made us introduce to various benchmarks that uses System C to analyze memory and cache behaviours.
We also learned about different communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, CAN, PCI etc. and its applications. 
In this course we also got introduced to various embedded system devices and its uses in IoT, automobile and different industries.
Lastly, in this course as a part of my project I performed a thorough literature survey on Code compression techniques for low power embedded systems which is explained in this repository in the
